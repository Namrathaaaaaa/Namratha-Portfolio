I want to update the code and I have few changes. I need for now. Remove the community page completely. I do not need that at all. Replace that with projects page so the flow should be on the number. It should be like home projects, blogs, resume ,contact me. There is resume in the folder, but it's not being displayed in the website. Fix all of this and remove the project from the homepage and shifted to a new section and project section as I mentioned before and in the homepage and work experience, you can get all the relevant data from the above Jason data.
Create the block section. Now I want the cards in the block section should be horizontal. It should have a title 23 lines of description and on the left side manually into the court directly and not as a additional feature. So what I need is, I needed to be in a folder structure where I can visit it and just update it every time along with this, it should have a redirect link to my media account.


create a innovative approach to display projects.
